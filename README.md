# get-github-app-token

This repository contains a custom workflow that can be used to obtain a GitHub App token for an App
installation in the Asana organization. The token is then used to authenticate with the GitHub API.

To learn how to use this Github Action, and for more on creating Github Apps that work in Asana's
Github Org, see the corresponding [Slab doc](https://asana.slab.com/posts/github-apps-nk1td7o8).
